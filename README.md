A simple iOS app demonstrating how to host a SpriteKit view inside a
regular UI app.


Typically a SpriteKit app will occupy the entire device screen. It also
has no hooks into the standard iOS UI and buttons, tables, etc all have
to be created from scratch. There is however a technique under which a
standard iOS UI app can host a game view. For details and a step-by-step
guide take a look at the [blog
post](http://swiftnotions.com/2017/04/27/ui-hosted-spritekit-view-
tutorial- part-1/) for this project.

This project was done in Xcode 8.3.2 and tested under iOS 10.3.
